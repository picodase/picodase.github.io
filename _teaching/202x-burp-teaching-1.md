I was a graduate student TA for Biochemistry II under Profs. Dana Miller and Liangcai Gu. Our text was the Lehninger "Principles of Biochemistry" by Nelson and Cox. I took notes during lecture, prepared explanatory slides each week, and held twice-weekly recitation sections for students. I worked closely with the teaching staff, synchronizing during weekly instructional meetings, and when grading course exams.

In addition I elected to deliver one 50-minute lecture to the class, after seeing a fellow TA do the same. I lectured on the translation apparatus; my slides are included (here)[/files/translation.odt].
