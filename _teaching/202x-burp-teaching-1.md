BURP is a quarter-long extracurricular study program for undergraduates interested in exploring the scientific literature. Undergraduates are paired with a mentor, and the two read papers together over the quarter, culminating in an optional symposium around Finals week. Since its inception, BURP has served over 100 undergraduates and 50 mentors in the UW Biochem community.
