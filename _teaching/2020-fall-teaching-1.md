I was an undergraduate TA for Thermodynamics under Wei Kong, selected because of my performance in the course the previous year, and my personal interest in the subject. Our text was "Physical Chemistry" by Silbey, Alberty, and Bawendi (2004). Because the course was remote, I illustrated concepts to students using an iPad, working through practice problems, and checking the work of students in the Zoom room. I worked closely with the teaching staff, synchronizing during weekly instructional meetings, and when grading course exams.
