I was a graduate student TA for Biochemistry I under Profs. Justin Kollman and Susan Brockerhoff. Our text was the Lehninger "Principles of Biochemistry" by Nelson and Cox. I took notes during lecture, prepared explanatory slides each week, and held twice-weekly recitation sections for students. I worked closely with the teaching staff, synchronizing during weekly instructional meetings, and when grading course exams.
