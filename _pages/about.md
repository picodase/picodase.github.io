About me
===
My name is Joy Menten (she/her) and I like proteins. I enjoy looking at proteins, comprehending how they work, and designing them for new functions. I hope to use protein modeling and design to better affirm the dignity of life as we together navigate global climate change.

My favorite proteins are the enzymes which *make possible* (nearly) all of the nonspontaneous chemical reactions in the tree of life. They do that using a number of catalytic strategies, referred to by some scholars as the "contributions to enzyme catalysis". They weave together substrates using physical forces, hold them together until they react, convert thermal energy into directional motion, and even use tools (cofactors) for particularly difficult reactions. Pretty cool, right? I think so too!

My professional path and goals
===
Since high school I've been learning how to solve and apply enzyme design towards difficult "global challenges" the world faces today: mitigating and reversing anthropogenic climate change, with special focus on carbon dioxide capture; enabling pharmaceutical synthesis at ambient temperature and pressure; and biosolar energy collection. I hope to build bioreactors for these reactions, and so promote a just transition to a renewable future: repairing the ecological impact of consumerist Western economies and fully supporting the material needs of peoples impacted by neo/colonialism.

My approach to implementing enzyme-based solutions to these challenges looks like this:
1. Identify and optimize individual single-reaction, naturally-derived catalytic domains across the tree of life
2. Design new catalytic domains using modern DL methods (theozyme search with DFT, RFDiffusion2/3, and ProteinMPNN)
3. Stitch together and program *de novo* enzyme synthases from this domain library (inspired by nature's polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthases)
4. Test designs experimentally, then design bioreactors fit-to-purpose

I approach computational enzyme modeling using a few methods, especially: deep learning-based protein modeling and design, molecular dynamics simulation, and electronic structure methods such as DFT. I worked on RoseTTAFold-allatom and RF3's `modelforge` for three years in grad school, where I built and tested novel DL-based modules for automated refinement of protein structures into electron density maps. I'm trying to work other forms of publically-available biophysical data into these DL networks, such as: NMR chemical shifts, high-res XRD maps, and SAXS volumes.
