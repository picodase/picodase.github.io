About me
===
My name is Joy Menten (she/her) and I like proteins. I enjoy looking at proteins, comprehending how they work, and design them for new functions. 

My favorites are the enzymes--those proteinaceous catalysts that *make possible* (nearly) all of the nonspontaneous chemical reactions in the tree of life. They do that using a number of catalytic strategies, referred to by some scholars as the "contributions to enzyme catalysis". They weave together substrates using physical forces, hold them together until they react, convert thermal energy into directional motion, and even use tools (cofactors) for particularly difficult reactions. Pretty cool, right? I think so too!

My professional path and goals
===
Since high school I've been learning how to solve and apply enzyme design towards difficult "global challenges" the world faces today: mitigating and reversing anthropogenic climate change, with focus on carbon dioxide capture; making pharmaceutical synthesis faster, cheaper, and productive at 1 ATM and near-room temperature; 

I'm focusing on a few key areas where I see the most potential for growth:
- Identify and optimize individual single-reaction, naturally-derived catalytic domains across the tree of life
- Design new catalytic domains using modern DL methods (theozyme search with DFT, RFDiffusion2/3, and ProteinMPNN)
- Stitch together and program *de novo* enzyme synthases from this domain library (inspired by nature's polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthases) 

I approach computational enzyme modeling using a few methods, especially: deep learning-based protein modeling and design, molecular dynamics simulation, and electronic structure methods such as DFT. I worked on RoseTTAFold-allatom and RF3's `modelforge` for three years in grad school, where I built and tested novel DL-based modules for automated refinement of protein structures into electron density maps. I'm trying to work other forms of publically-available biophysical data into these DL networks, such as: NMR chemical shifts, high-res XRD maps, and SAXS volumes.

What I'm reading
===
- Richard Martin, 2017 - Electronic structure: basic theory and practical methods
  Helps me build a rigorous understanding of modern quantum simulation, e.g. for theozyme generation and active site analysis)
- Perry Frey & Adrian Hegeman, 2007 - Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms
  Ultimately, the best enzymes were made by Nature. How do natural enzymes function? What can we learn from them?
- Silbey & Bawendi, 2004 - Physical Chemistry
  Finishing up this tome from P-chem in undergrad.
