My name is Joy Menten (she/her) and I like proteins. I enjoy looking at protein structures, comprehending how they work, and designing them for new functions. I apply protein modeling and design to affirm the dignity of all life on Earth as we navigate global climate change.

My passions
===

My favorite proteins are the [enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme) which *make possible* (nearly) all of the nonspontaneous chemical reactions in the tree of life, inside and outside of the cell. Each one leverages multiple "strategies", referred to by some scholars (including myself) as the "contributions to enzyme catalysis". They weave together substrates using physical forces, hold them together until they react, convert thermal energy into directional motion, and they even use specialized tools (cofactors) for particularly difficult reactions. Pretty cool, right? I think so too!

I advocate for open access knowledge, free and open source software (FOSS), open schematic instrumentation and hardware (OSH), inclusive science, [slow science](https://theconversation.com/reliable-science-takes-time-but-the-current-system-rewards-speed-249497), [self-directed learning](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/da2d/8529cbdc1cb3d1cf5039c2e2b4b43b784ea6.pdf), project-based learning, [indigenous ways-of-knowing](https://education.usask.ca/documents/profiles/aikenhead/IKS_revisited.pdf), non-hierarchical learning environments, trauma-informed community building, and [nonviolent communication](https://nonviolentcommunication.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4part_nvc_process.pdf). 

I believe that I must reckon with the [troubled history](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Eugenics-and-Scientific-Racism) of my scientific ancestors in order to conduct rigorous and just science today. Repairing harms and finding justice someday requires we embrace [anti-bigotry discrimination](https://www.ibramxkendi.com/how-to-be-an-antiracist/) _today_ (e.g., anti-racism, anti-transphobia, anti-misogyny). We will get there someday, but we will have to be brave.

My favorite software is the text editor [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) that I use daily. Emacs' `org-mode` organizes my scientific journal, and [`org-roam`](https://www.orgroam.com/) structures my personal knowledge graph (Note: I will link it here some day!) 

My goals
===
Since high school I've been learning how to solve and apply enzyme design towards difficult "global challenges" the world faces today: mitigating and reversing anthropogenic climate change, with special focus on [carbon dioxide capture](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39311668/) and [pollutant biodegradation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30660847/); enabling pharmaceutical synthesis at ambient temperature and pressure; and biosolar energy collection. I hope to build bioreactors for these reactions, and so promote a just transition to a renewable future: repairing the ecological impact of consumerist Western economies and fully supporting the material needs of peoples impacted by neo/colonialism.

My approach to implementing enzyme-based solutions to these challenges looks like this:
1. Identify and optimize individual single-reaction, naturally-derived catalytic domains across the tree of life
2. Design new catalytic domains using modern DL methods (theozyme search with DFT, RFDiffusion2/3, and ProteinMPNN)
3. Stitch together and program *de novo* enzyme synthases from this domain library (inspired by nature's polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthases)
4. Test designs experimentally, then design bioreactors fit-to-purpose

I approach computational enzyme modeling using a few methods, especially: deep learning-based protein modeling and design, molecular dynamics simulation, and electronic structure methods such as DFT. I worked on RoseTTAFold-allatom and RF3's `modelforge` for three years in grad school, where I developed novel DL-based modules for automated refinement of protein structures into electron density maps. I'm trying to work other forms of publically-available biophysical data into these DL networks, such as: NMR chemical shifts, high-res XRD maps, and SAXS volumes.

What I'm reading
===
I spend a lot of my spare time reading. Here's what I've been reading lately:

- Richard Martin, 2017 - [Electronic structure: basic theory and practical methods, 1st Ed.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/electronic-structure/DDFE838DED61D7A402FDF20D735BC63A): To bring me up to date on modern quantum simulation methods, e.g. for transition state search and active site analysis.
- P. Frey & A. Hegeman, 2007 - [Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/enzymatic-reaction-mechanisms-9780195122589): Ultimately, the best enzymes were made by nature. How do natural enzymes function? What can we learn from them?
- R. J. Silbey, R. A. Alberty, & M. G. Bawendi, 2004 - [Physical Chemistry, 4th Ed.](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Physical%20Chemistry,%204th%20Edition-p-9780471215042): Finishing up this tome from physical chemistry in undergrad--P chem was my favorite subject!
- D. F. Shriver, P. W. Atkins, & C. H. Langford, 1990 - [Inorganic Chemistry](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.19901021121): I didn't get a chance to take inorganic chem in graduate school.

I think every scientist should read J. Zimring's [What science is and how it really works](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/what-science-is-and-how-it-really-works/C48DFCEFA3FD72AB793CC30B0EE656B7) (2019). It's simply the best-structured analysis of cognitive biases inherent to human existence, it separates science from non-science, and it's made me a better scientist. I'm working my way around to a second reading soon.
